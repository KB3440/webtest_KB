      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTMl constructs,
      images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into
      the rendered page. It provides a means to create sturctured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraph, lists,
      links, quotes and other items. HTML elemets are delineated by tags,
      written using angle brackets.
